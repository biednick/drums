### Overview

Based on the DSP-L8 drum voice chip, this module offers 8 polyphonic drum sounds in a small package. Featuring cabasa, agogo, timbale, whistle, quijada, maraca, congo, and chime sounds, each voice can be triggered individually and the maraca, chime, whistle, agogo, timbale, and quijada can be individually tuned.

### Design

Utilizing an ATMega 328 chip, this module can be easily programmed with the Arduino IDE and an ISP Programmer. A 7805 regulator removes the need for a 5v rail on your PSU, and as an all digital module the current draw is very low. The code used was written by Jan Osterman. I have chosen to rehost Jan's code as his hosting method causes numerous compilation errors.

### Buy

I'll be updating this part soon with a link to buy PCBs on Reverb. For the time being you can email me to purchase development PCBs at a discount. These will be fully functional but have minor issues. In the case of the Drum PCBs, the programming header must be soldered to the front side of the PCB, meaning the front panel must be removed to program the module. In addition, the back of the board is missing silk screen.
